# DifficultyModifier
This mod allows you to control the difficulty of the game during a run.
You can also decide to pause the difficulty momentarily if it becomes too challenging, and then unpause when you've caught up!

### Controls
  - CTRL + "Numpad +" -> Increase the difficulty
  - CTRL + "Numpad -" -> Decrease the difficulty
  - CTRL + "Numpad *" -> Increases the difficulty step
  - CTRL + "Numpad /" -> Decreases the difficulty step
  - CTRL + "P" -> Pause the difficulty
  - CTRL + "I" -> Check the current debug difficulty settings (coefficients, monster level and total added difficulty).

All the debug text is displayed in the Unity console. Press CTRL + ALT + ` to open it.

### Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with any other mods available. If you find one it is not compatible with, please open an issue on [GitHub/NewIssue](https://github.com/Elzheiz/ror2-difficulty-modifier/issues/new) or message me on Discord.

This mod has not been tested in Multiplyer yet, so please be aware it might not work or lead to bugs.
